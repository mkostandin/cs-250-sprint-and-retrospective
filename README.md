How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Interpreting user needs means thoroughly understanding the goals and problems that users are facing. For the SNHU Travel project, creating user stories helped break down complex user needs into smaller, actionable tasks that the development team could easily focus on. Each user story addressed a specific user requirement, making it straightforward to prioritize and implement features that provided the most value. This approach ensured that the final product aligned closely with user expectations and was easy to navigate.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, I start with planning and breaking the requirements into manageable parts. In the SNHU Travel project, I used Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. These practices helped me stay organized, prioritize tasks effectively, and adapt based on evolving requirements. In future projects, I hope to use Agile practices like iterative development and continuous integration to quickly adapt to feedback and maintain a high standard of quality.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means being dependable, actively communicating, and showing empathy towards others. During the SNHU Travel project, I learned the importance of openly sharing progress and challenges during daily stand-ups, which helped the team remain aligned and focused on our common goals. It also means being adaptableâ€”sometimes taking on additional roles, like supporting testers or helping solve issues outside of my immediate responsibilities. Overall, contributing to a positive team environment helps drive the project forward and ensures everyone succeeds together.
